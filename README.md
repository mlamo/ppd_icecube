# Overview

There are three main notebooks:
- `introduction_python.ipynb` contains a basic introduction to Python programming
- `project_work.ipynb` is the main notebook for students, with cells to fill
- `project_solution.ipynb` is a proposed solution to questions in `project_work.ipynb`

# Input files

There are two inputs for the analysis:
- IceCube point-source data from 2008 to 2018m to be downloaded and copied in `inputs/icecube_10year_ps` (see `install/README.md`).
- List of astrophysical sources to be probed in `inputs/sources.csv` (same list as used in [IceCube analysis](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.051103)).
