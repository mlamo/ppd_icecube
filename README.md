# Overview

There are three main notebooks:
- `intro_notebook.ipynb` contains a basic introduction to Python programming
- `work_notebook.ipynb` is the main notebook for students, with cells to fill
- `solution_notebook.ipynb` is a proposed solution to questions in `work_notebook.ipynb`

# Input files

There are two inputs for the analysis:
- IceCube point-source data from 2008 to 2018 ([link](https://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases/2021/01/all-sky-point-source-icecube-data-years-2008-2018/)) in `inputs/icecube_10year_ps`. The folder contains not only the raw data (subfolder `events`) but also other info we may discuss about if there is time to do some advance topics (not prepared).
- List of astrophysical sources to be probed in `inputs/sources.csv` (same list as used in [IceCube analysis](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.051103)).
